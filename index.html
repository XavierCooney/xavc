                    This online tool was originally designed for a school philosophy class when
                    we were discussing the concept of logic. The system models
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus">propositional calculus (or zeroth-order logic)</a>
                    by constructing a truth table for every valuation.

                <p>
                    To do this, I wrote a recursive descent parser (with operator precedence) which transforms the various expressions
                    (all the premises and the conclusion) into an abstract syntax tree, which is then evaluated
                    for every row in the virtual truth table.

                    The tool also includes 28 examples which can be loaded with the click of the button, including
                    various common axioms used to form logical systems, as well as formal fallacies. Furthermore, the site
                    contains the ability to save and share a given logical system by encoding it in the URL.

            <p>
                When our Software Design & Development class was learning about sorting algorithms, I
                created a sorting visualiser to aid learning. Although there are a number of online tools
                and YouTube videos which show sorting algorithms in a similar manner, this tool
                is specifically designed for assisting in understanding the algorithms. The actually sorting
                is performed by an interpreter for a pseudocode-like language, similar to that of the
                <a href="https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/wcm/connect/44325629-51c6-4330-8bf8-662d5cfbe5fb/software-design-development-course-specs.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=#page=35">NSW Education Standard Authority</a>.
                This allows students to step through the program written in a manner in which they are learning,
                line by line, while they can see the state of the array-to-be-sorted, as well as all the variables. For
                each integer variable, the user can select for that variable to be visualised as an index into the array,
                which proved to be very useful.
            </p>
            <p>
                As well as the three NESA specified sorting algorithms of insertion sort, bubble sort and selection sort, the
                tool also has pseudocode-like implementations of a variety of other sorts, including quicksort, heapsort,
                shellsort, and other more esoteric algorithms.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Chemical equilibria are an important concept in chemistry, particularly in the
                year 12 chemistry NESA syllabus. Thus, when I my class began learning about equilibriums,
                I created this online tool. I found that the development of this tool greatly assisted my understanding
                of the topic. The visualiser has a number of options and buttons, but it's main purpose is to
                simulate an equilibrium between 'red particles' and 'blue particles'. The blue particles will 'react' to red,
                and the red to blue based on the equilbrium constant, K<sub>eq</sub>, selected by the user. Users can then
                observe the reaction occuring, as the blue particles 'swap' to the red side and vice versa. Users
                can then quantitatively analyse the state of the system, both with numeric displays and with the automatic
                graph. The tool is highly interactive, allowing particles to be added or removed, the reaction rate
                and equilibrium constant to be changed, and the graph and other parameters to be altered, all while the simulation
                is running.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulation can run probabilistically, using the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution</a>, or just based on
                the expected amount of reaction, with rounding corrected for. The former is a truer represtentation of how
                the specific set of particles would look like in equilbrium, while the latter allows for far larger systems
                (which are much more relevant to the systems studied in chemistry) to be simulated and examined.

            <p>
                When my year 12 physics class were learning about how the motor effect can be used to create useful rotation,
                I decided to see if I could use the equations we had learnt and create an actually physically accurate simulation.
                Doing so purely algebricallly is non-trivial, but by using numeric integration, this tool allows users
                to simulate the motor effect to a moderately to high degree of physical accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tool allows for extensive phyiscal parameter configuration, from the length of the conductor to the
                strength of the external magnetic field. Users can also select a 'control system', to simulate the commutator
                on brushed DC motors, as well as other situations. For more information on the details of the simulation,
                check out the information box at the bottom of the simulator page.
